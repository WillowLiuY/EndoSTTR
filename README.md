# Endoscopic STereo Transformer (EndoSTTR)

EndoSTTR is a stereo depth estimation model for medical endoscopic scenes using transformer.  Itâ€™s designed to handle the unique challenges of endoscopy and provide accurate depth predictions.

This project is based on the [STTR model](https://github.com/mli0603/stereo-transformer), with tweaks and improvements for medical applications.

## Dependencies
- Create your python virtual environment by 
    ``` sh
    conda create --name sttr python=3.6 # create a virtual environment called "sttr" with python version 3.6
    ```
    (Python version >= 3.6)
- **Install Pytorch**: Please follow link [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

     (PyTorch version >= 1.5.1)
  
- **Other third-party packages**: You can use pip to install the dependencies by 
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
#### Using Colab to inference
Under the scripts folder, you'll find the Inference.ipynb file which can be directly run on the colab.

#### Training on your own dataset
- In terminal, run training by
    ```
    sh scripts/train.sh
    ```
